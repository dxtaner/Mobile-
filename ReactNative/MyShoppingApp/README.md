Project Structure
-----------------

### `Router.js`

The main navigation router that handles the app's navigation flow based on authentication state.

#### Features:

*   Uses `@react-navigation/native` for navigation
*   Integrates with Redux to check authentication state
*   Displays either:
    *   `Landing` component during authentication loading
    *   `StackNavigator` with user session after loading

#### Dependencies:

*   `react-redux` for state management
*   `@react-navigation/native` for navigation

### `App.js`

The root component of the application that sets up the Redux store and provides global UI components.

#### Features:

*   Wraps the app with Redux `Provider`
*   Implements `SafeAreaView` for proper device display
*   Includes `StatusBar` configuration
*   Uses `KeyboardAvoidingView` to handle keyboard appearance (especially on iOS)

#### Dependencies:

*   `react-redux` for state management
*   React Native core components (`SafeAreaView`, `StatusBar`, `KeyboardAvoidingView`)

Setup Instructions
------------------

1.  Install dependencies:
    
        npm install @react-navigation/native react-redux @react-navigation/stack
    
2.  For React Navigation, install required native dependencies:
    
        npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
    
3.  For iOS, install pods:
    
        cd ios && pod install && cd ..
    

Redux Integration
-----------------

The app expects the Redux store to have:

*   `user` state for user session information
*   `isAuthLoading` state to track authentication loading state

Platform Specific Behavior
--------------------------

The `KeyboardAvoidingView` automatically adjusts:

*   On iOS: uses 'padding' behavior
*   On Android: uses default behavior (no extra padding)

Status Bar
----------

Configured with:

*   Dark content (for light backgrounds)
*   White background color

Running the App
---------------

Start the development server:

    npm start

Then run on your platform:

    npm run android
    # or
    npm run ios
