# React Native Navigation Example

This project demonstrates a basic React Native application using React Navigation v6 with `createNativeStackNavigator`. It features three simple screens: Welcome, Member Sign, and Member Result.

## App Demo

## Project Structure

    .
    ├── App.js
    └── pages
        ├── MemberResult.js
        ├── MemberSign.js
        └── Welcome.js

- `App.js`: The main application file that sets up the navigation.
- `pages/`: Contains the individual screen components.
  - `Welcome.js`: A welcome screen.
  - `MemberSign.js`: A screen for member sign-up.
  - `MemberResult.js`: A screen to display member sign-up results.

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- React Navigation v6 (`@react-navigation/native`, `@react-navigation/native-stack`)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

            `git clone https://github.com/dxtaner/Mobile-/tree/master/MyRegistrationApp         cd MyRegistrationApp`

2.  **Install dependencies:**

            `npm install           # or           yarn install`

3.  **Install React Navigation dependencies:**

            `npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context           #or           yarn add @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context`

4.  **Install pods for iOS (if applicable):**

            `npx pod-install ios`

## Running the Application

### For Android:

    `npx react-native run-android`

### For iOS:

    `npx react-native run-ios`

## Usage

The application navigates between three screens:

- **Welcome Screen:** The initial screen.
- **Member Sign Screen:** Allows users to input member information.
- **Member Result Screen:** Displays the entered member information.

## Notes

- This is a basic example for demonstration purposes.
- You can customize the screens and add more features as needed.
- Ensure you have the necessary development environment set up for React Native development.
- The `screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }}` property in `Stack.Navigator` hides the header for all screens.
